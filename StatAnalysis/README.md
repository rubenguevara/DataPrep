# StatAnalysis
The codebase for the mass limit plots. 
The imported scripts pyStats.py, limitPlot.py and MC_Bayes_withBkgCorr.cpp were made by Dr. Bugge and can be found here: https://github.uio.no/zpath/software/tree/master/Scripts/Statistics <br/>
In addition, the script to make 2D-exclusions was made by Dr. Gramstad, and as it is a work of art it is called munch.py, it can be found here: https://github.uio.no/zpath/software/tree/master/Scripts/SUSYPheno <br/>
As limitPlot.py was edited, I include the edited version here.
