Now that we have established the necessary theoretical groundwork of particle physics, it's time to explore how this knowledge can be applied. This leads us to ask important questions such as, 
how can we measure what we have learned? How do we put it into practice? Most importantly, how can we use this understanding to uncover new discoveries?\\
\\To answer these questions, we have divided this chapter into three sections, each of which will focus on a different aspect of experimental particle physics. The first section will delve into particle production, 
followed by a examination of particle detection with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, and finally, we will explore the intricacies of data analysis in particle physics.\\
\\By exploring these areas, we hope to provide a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of particle physics, while also highlighting the practical applications of this knowledge.

\section{Particle production}
As we have already seen the shape of the SM we are now ready to dive into the subject of how we can produce the particles that we wish to detect. In this chapter we will start from the basic kinematics of particles 
and then move to more complex variables that will be of use when analysing data from detectors. The material for the first section is based on Thomson book Modern Particle Physics \cite{THOMSON}, Jacksons "Kinematics" \cite{Jackson_kin}.
and Vadlas PhD. thesis \cite{KNUT_VADLA}.

\subsection{Particle kinematics}\label{sec:particle_kinematics}
As proved by Einstein, everything in spacetime can be described by four-vectors\todo{Is this comment unnecesary?}. For the purposes of particle physics, where we are mainly interested in the motion of particles, 
we will look at the four momentum. Instead of using general variables as Einstein did, we will describe the particles using the four momentum in terms of the geometry of the decetors, that means we will use 
the polar angle, $\theta$, and the azimuthal angle, $\phi$, such that we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:four-momentum}
    p^\mu = (E, p_x, p_y, p_z) \overset{Lab}{\longrightarrow} (E, p_T\cos\phi, p_T\sin\phi, \abs{\mathbf{p}}\cos\theta)
\end{equation}
where $p_T$ is the \textit{transverse momentum} expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transverse_momentum}
    p_T \equiv\sqrt{p_x^2 +p_y^2} = \abs{\mathbf{p}}\sin\theta
\end{equation}
The energy and momentum can be expressed in relativisic quantities, $E=\gamma\beta$ and $\mathbf{p}=\gamma m\bm\beta$, where $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$ and $\bm\beta = \mathbf{v}/c$\footnote{As this is a particle physics thesis I will convert to Natural Units where we set $c=1$} 
where $m$ is the mass of the particle 
and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. By contracting\footnote{Using the particle physicists convention of the minkowsky metric tensor $\eta_{\mu\nu}$,  (+, -, -, -)} two four-momentum we get the important Lorentz invariant 
square of the \textit{invariant mass}
$$
    m^2 = p_\mu p^\mu = E^2 - \abs{\mathbf{p}}^2 
$$
which can be generalized for a system containing $n$ particles as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:invariant_mass}
    m^2 = p_\mu p^\mu = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n E_i\right)^2 - \left(\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbf{p}_i\right)^2
\end{equation}
As this thesis will focus on a dilepton final (and missing transverse energy) final state, which is of the type $2\rightarrow2$ $(+MET)$ then the invariant mass of the two leptons in the final state will be of interest 
we will denote this as $m_{ll}$. From this we can also get another interesting variable, the \textit{transverse energy}. This follows diretly from the same equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transverse_energy}
    E_T = \sqrt{m^2 + p_T^2}
\end{equation}
The invariant mass is what we measure in the final state only. But as we are going to use data\footnote{And mostly simmulations mimicking the ATLAS detector} from the LHC, from which the initial state is made controlled by us, 
it will be of interest to see what the total energy and momentum of the two protons is. The term for this is called the \textit{centre-of-mass} energy, $\sqrt s$, where $s$ is defined by the same formula in Eq. (\ref{eq:invariant_mass}), 
with the difference beeing that we look at the initial particles. For this thesis we will look at data and simmulations of Run II from the LHC, which had $\sqrt s = 13$ TeV. \\
\\As this thesis aims to search for DM, which we know does not interact with matter in the same way as neutrinos \todo{add sources}, meaning it leaves no signal in detectors. 
As we know both the centre of mass energy, $\sqrt s$, and the invariant mass of all particles in the final state, Eq. (\ref{eq:invariant_mass}). Then the presence of the non-interacting particles can often be 
inferred from the presence of \textit{missing transverse energy}\footnote{Also called \textit{missing momentum}} (MET), which is defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MET}
    E_T^{miss} = \mathbf{p}_{miss} \equiv -\sum_i \mathbf{p}_{T,i}
\end{equation}
where the sum extends over the measured momenta of all the observed particles in an event. From this formula, if all particles produced in the collision have been detected, then this sum should be zero. Meaning that 
siginifiant MET is therefore indicative of the presence of an undetected particle. \\
\\Another useful kinematic variable is the \textit{hadronic activity} which is the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of all jets in an event, defined as
\begin{equation}
    H_T = \sum_{i\in\{jets\}} \vert\vert \mathbf{p}_{T,i}\vert\vert
\end{equation}
this gives a measurement of the hadronic energy scale of an event. Another handy trick comes from the reailization that since the centre-of-mass frame is between the hadrons, where the total momentum is given as a function of the energy of the hadron\todo{This sentence is inspired from Elizabeth Christensen, but I don't want to repeat what she said...}. 
Meaning that the final state particles are boosted along the beam axis. With this realization we can now introduce a Lorentz invariant\footnote{Under boosts along the beam axis} kinematic property known as the \textit{rapidity, y} used to express the lepton angles
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rapidity}
    y \equiv \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z}\right)  
\end{equation} 
where we can use $p_Z = E\cos\theta$ as we neglect the mass in the high-energy limit. In this limit we can use the \textit{pseudorapidity}, $\eta$, defined By
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pseudorapidity}
    \eta \equiv -\ln\left(\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
The pseudorapidity is an interesting variable as it can tell us how close to the beam the final state particles are, where the higher $\vert\eta\vert$ means closer to the beam. This variable can also be negative, meaning backwards scattering. 
From this we can define a new variable which will come handy with particle identification, which is called the \textit{R-cone}, that defines a cirlce in $(\eta,\phi)$-space surrounding the object of interest. It is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:R-cone}
    \Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2}
\end{equation}
Another interesting variable is the \textit{transverse mass}, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transverse_mass}
    m_T^2 = m^2 + p_T^2
\end{equation}
where $m^2$ is the invraiant mass defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:invariant_mass}). What is interesting with this variable is that it is the equivalent of the invariant mass equation, that takes into account invisible particles! 
We can take this further by looking at a supersymmetric version of the transverse mass, which calculates a transverse mass for two leptons by distributing the total $p_T^{miss}$ among the two systems, 
and minimizing the maximum of the two transverse masses by varying the distribution of the $p_T^{miss}$-vector in terms of the size of $q_T$. This is called the \textit{stransverse mass} and is defined by
\begin{equation}
    m_{T2}^2(\chi) = \underset{\slashed{\mathbf{q}}^{(1)}_T + \slashed{\mathbf{q}}^{(2)}_T = \slashed{\mathbf{p}}_T}{\min}
    \left[\max \left\{m_T^2\left(\mathbf{p}_T^{\ell_1}, \slashed{\mathbf{q}}^{(1)}_T;\chi\right), m_T^2\left(\mathbf{p}_T^{\ell_2}, \slashed{\mathbf{q}}^{(2)}_T;\chi\right) 
    \right\}\right] 
\end{equation}
where $\slashed{\mathbf{q}}_T$ are "dummy 2-vectors", $\chi$ is a free parameter used to "guess" the mass of the invisible particle, and $m_T^2\left(\mathbf{p}_T, \mathbf{q}_T\right)$ is an application of 
Eq. (\ref{eq:transverse_mass}) using two particles:
$$
m_T^2 \left(\mathbf{p}_T, \mathbf{q}_T\right) = 2(p_T q_T - \mathbf{p}_T\cdot\mathbf{q}_T)
$$
For a more detailed explanation and interpretation of the stransverse mass I refer the reader to the paper by Barr et.al. \cite{Barr_2003}. Even though the stransverse mass was made with neutralinos in mind, it can still 
be used to calculate SM processes. For example, if we want to reduce $WW$ background events, we can first recall that each boson can decay as $W\rightarrow l+\nu_l$ with the $W$ mass as an endpoint. 
Meaning that we can use $m_{T2}$ to reduce the $WW$ events in a dilepton final state by requiring that $m_{T2} > m_W$.

\subsection{Proton-proton collisions}
With all the kinematics out of the way the question of how the particles are produces still remains. The answer to that is protons. The way we produce elementary particles to study is by colliding two protons togheter.
The reason as to why this works is because protons are also made of elementary particles, two \textit{up} and one \textit{down} to be specific\footnote{As well as gluons and partons exisiting inside of it}.
Because of this it is not hard to realize that the Feynman rules aquired from the SM also apply here.

\section{The ATLAS detector}
We have so far on this chapter discussed how particles are produces. But we so far not yet explained how we actually detect them, arguably the most important matter in the field of high energy particle physics!
This section of the chapter is just about that, and we will explain how the detection happens in A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS, or more commonly know as the ATLAS detector. Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_detector} showcases 
the detector and its size. The information of this section is largely based on the original ATLAS Collaboration introduction\todo{from my understanding, correct me if wrong!} paper presented to CERN 
\cite{Aad:1129811}. (and Knuts thesis \cite{KNUT_VADLA} that described it in a more undertandable way ). \\
\\The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) detector is a general multi-purpose\footnote{Probing \textit{p-p} and \textit{A-A} (heavy ions) collisions.} detector located at the LHC and covers nearly the entire solid angle 
around the collision point, as described with $(\eta,\phi)-$coordinates in Section \ref{sec:particle_kinematics}. The ATLAS detector consists of four main subdetectors; ($i$) an inner tracking detector (ID), 
an ($ii$) electromgetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a ($iii$) hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), and lastly ($iv$) a muon spectrometer (MS). Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers} visualises the four $(i)-(iv)$ main sub-detectors, 
along with how the different particle types interact with each layer. A brief description of each layer is explained through Section \ref{sec:ID}-\ref{sec:MS}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Inner detector}\label{sec:ID} 
The inner-detector (ID) system is immersed in a 2T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range $\abs{\eta}<2.5$. The ID provides the first measurements of the 
momentum and identification of electrically charged particles, as these can be determined by the curvature of their reconstructed tracks. 
The ID is made of three independent systems; the pixel detector, the semiconductor tracker (SCT) and 
the transition radiation tracker (TRT). \\
\\The pixel detector is made up of 80 million sillicon pixel sensors, each of size $50\times400\mu$m$^2$, %with a resolution of $14\times155\mu$m$^2$, 
and spread over multiple layers. Outside the pixel layers 
are the SCTs, which consist of sillicon microstrips trackers, also placed on multiple layers. The SCT covers the pseudorapidity region $\abs{\eta}<2.5$. Furthest away from the interaction point lies the TRTs, 
they consist of 4mm in diameter straw tubes, which enables track-following up to $\abs{\eta}=2.0$ 

\subsection{The calorimeters}\label{sec:calories}
The ATLAS detector has two types of calorimeters, the \textit{electromagnetic calorimeter} (ECAL) and the \textit{hadronic calorimeter} (HCAL), both designed to fully stop certain types of particles. 
Both calorimeters covers a pseudorapidity range $\abs{\eta}<4.9$. The ECAL is immidiately surroinding the inner detector and is divided into a barrel part ($\abs{\eta}<1.475$) and two end-cap components ($1.375<\abs{\eta}<3.2$). 
The ECAL consists of absorbing lead plates, with liquid Argon (LAr) in between. The thickness of the calorimeter is made to fully measure the shower of photons and electron/positrons. The muons will only lose 
a small fraction of their energy as they have longer interaction lenghts with lead.\\
\\The HCAL is immediatelly surroinding the ECAL on all sides and consists of two types of detectors. In the barrel ($\abs{\eta}<1.0$) and the extended barrel regions ($0.8<\abs{\eta}<1.7$), the HCAL is made of 
steel plates with plastic scintillator tiles as active material. While on the end-cap regions ($1.5<\abs{\eta}<3.2$) there are hadronic LAr detectors, with absorbing copper plates as active material; in the 
forward region ($3.1<\abs{\eta}<4.9$) a combination of copper and tungsted plates are used as active material. The active materials are chosen to maximze the ineraction cross-section with hadrons, such as neutrons, 
protons and pions. The depth of the HCALs is also designed to fully stop the particles and their showers in order to measure their total energies. Hadrons are efficiently stopped at the HCALs, meaning that only 
muons and invisible particles, such as neutrinos and potentially dark matter, leave the HCAL.

\subsection{Muon spectrometer}\label{sec:MS}
The outermost layer of the ATLAS detector is the \textit{muon spectometer} (MS), dedicated to the measurement of the muons momenta. The MS, similar to the ID, consists of multiple layers of detector material, 
and is immersen in a strong magnetic field to bend the trajectories of the charged muons. The MS is made of four different types of detector component: $(i)$ Monitored Drift Tubes (MDTs) on the barrel, 
$(ii)$ Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) dealing with the events closer to the beam line in the end cap, $(iii)$ Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the barrel and ($iv$) Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs) in the end caps. 
The MDTs and CSCs are used for tracking while the RPCs and TGCs are used for tiggers. The tracking is provided for pseudorapidities up to $\abs{\eta}<2.7$, and the trigger system only extends to $\abs{\eta}<2.4$.

\subsection{Summary of ATLAS}
We can now dive into how particles are identified now that the main four parts of the ATLAS detector; \textit{inner-detector} (ID), \textit{electromagnetic calorimeter} (ECAL), \textit{hadronic calorimeter} (HCAL), and the \textit{muon spectometer} (MS), have 
briefly been explained. For an easier understanding on the different parts I refer the reader again to Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers} which shows visually how different particles interact with the detector. We can start by noting tht there are only three types 
of particles that interact with the ID, muons, protons and electrons (there might also be other ellectrically charged hadrons that interact withg the ID). From the ID pixel and SCT detectors we can get information about $\phi,\eta, p_T$ and from the TRT we  
can get to know the \textit{the charge} of the particles (depending on how the magnet bends their trajectories)\footnote{So as we know that the proton is positively charged, then we know that the muon and electron in Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers} have negative charge}. 
Going to the next layer we see that in the ECAL the electron is completely stopped, such that we can know its energy, $E$. We can also note that the photons will interact with matter here and also be completely stopped. It is worth noting that in just the two 
first detector parts we have all the information we need to calculate interesting kinematic variables for the electron and photons. Going further into the detector, we see that the HCAL completely stops the proton and now interacts with the neutrons, giving us 
information about their energies (and location for neutrons). Lastly we see that the muon flyes through all of this and finally hits the MS where we can get information about its energy. \textit{\textbf{Note/Question to Farid/Eirik: Why does it not stop?}}. \\
\\The noteworthy particle in Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers}, which was not mentioned in the summary above either, is the \textit{neutrino}. The reason for this is because the neutrino, just like DM, is an \textit{invisible particle}, meaning that it does not 
interact with matter. We can still reconstruct information about the neutrino and DM howevever, we do this as explained in Section \ref{sec:particle_kinematics} with variables such as the MET, Eq. (\ref{eq:MET}), as we know the centre of mass energy that went 
into the collision. \\
\\Another thing to add is that the explanation of the detector is brief in this thesis. The reality is much more complicated than this as there are, i.e. \textit{triggers} (which might be excluding DM events) choosing which events are 
"important enough to record" as the \textit{hardware and data storage} is a big problem considering the magnitude of events that happen each second. There are as well as algorithmic precedures to calculate the variables aforementioned from the detector signal 
which both consume energy and time. As this is not the focus of my thesis I will refer the reader to further literature explaining the real hardships when collecting data at the ATLAS detector and other LHC projects. \\

\section{Data analysis}
The time has come to explore how we can search for new physics phenomena, now that it has been established how particles are produced and how we detect them. In this section we will take into account the classic way of searching for new phyics which is called 
the \textit{cut and count method}\todo{cut n' count is the informal name, what is the real one?}, but there are other methods to search for new physics, such as Machine Learning (ML) which is the method pursued in this thesis. There might be other methods, such as 
Quantum ML, but as of today we are still in an early stage of the technology \cite{QML} \todo{can I include this?}. To give a short description of the cut and count method, it makes kinematial \textit{cuts} such that we isolate signal from background. The way 
the signal and background are made is by Monte Carlo (MC) simmulations, such that we can more easily identify SM background from DM and then compare our results with real data. As it wouldn't be a real expreimental physics discovery without making a statistical 
analysis of the \textit{significance} of the \textit{cut signal region} we will also explain how we measure these. To guide us through this process I will use the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012 \cite{Higgs_discovery_2012} as an example of the sucess of these methods.

\subsection{Cut and count}
The cut and count...





\subsection{Statistical analysis}
To make any sort of claim in modern physics we should be absolutely certain that what we are claiming is true, as just making the cuts and isolating a signal to background is not enough. To be specific we need to be \textit{at least $5\sigma$ sure} to claim any new discoveries \todo{add source to why 5?}. 
What $5\sigma$ means, and how we can get there is what this subection is all about. But as not everything in experimantal high energy particle physics is a new discovery, but is in fact for the most part \textit{exclusions}. Then we need to explain what an exlusion is, and how to make them. \\ 
\\This thesis is following Dr. Bugges lecture notes on statistics [\textbf{how do I cite his powerpoint from FYS5555}] and the example set by the ATLAS Collaboration article "Search for new particles in events with one lepton and missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector" \cite{Stat},
where a Bayesian analysis is performed to set limits on the studied processes. Going back to the discovery of the Higgs boson, for each candidate mass and decay channel, events are counted above a $m_{ll}$ threshold. Using the signal+backround hypotesis, the expected number of events in each channel is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expected_events}
    N_{\text{exp}} = \varepsilon_{\text{sig}}L_{\text{int}}\sigma B + N_{\text{bkg}}
\end{equation}
where $L_{\text{int}}$ is the integrated luminosity, $\varepsilon_{\text{sig}}$ is the signal selection efficiency defined as the fraction of signal events that satisfy the event selection criteria, $N_{\text{bkg}}$ is the expected number of background events, and $\sigma B$ is the 
cross-section times branching ratio of the process. Using Poisson statistics, the likelihood to observe $N_{\text{obs}}$ events is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:observed_events_prob}
    \mathcal{L}(N_{\text{obs}}\vert \sigma B) = \frac{(N_{\text{exp}})^{N_{\text{obs}}}e^{-N_{\text{exp}}}}{N_{\text{obs}}!}
\end{equation}
We include uncertainties by introducing nuisance parameters $\theta_i$, each with a probability density function $g_i(\theta_i)$, and integrating the product of the Poisson likelihood with the probability density function. The integrated likelihood is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:observed_events_nuisance}
    \mathcal{L}_B(N_{\text{obs}}\vert \sigma B)=\int\mathcal{L}(N_{\text{obs}}\vert \sigma B)\prod g_i(\theta_i)d\theta_i
\end{equation}
where a log-normal distribution is used for the $g_i(\theta_i)$. The nuisance parameters are taken to be: $L_{\text{int}}, \varepsilon_{\text{sig}}$ and $N_{\text{bkg}}$, with the appropriate correlation accounted for between the first and the third parameters. The measurements of 
the two decay channels (muon or electron final state for $H\rightarrow lll'l'$) are combined assuming the same branching fraction for each, thus Eq. \ref{eq:observed_events_nuisance} remains valid with the Poisson likelihood replaced by the product of the Poisson likelihoods for the two channels. 
The integrated luminosities for the electron and muon channels are fully correlated. We can further use Bayes' theorem which gives the posterior probability that the signal has signal strength $\sigma B$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prior_prob}
    P_{\text{post}}(\sigma B\vert N_{\text{obs}}) = N \mathcal{L}_B (N_{\text{obs}}\vert\sigma B) P_{\text{prior}}(\sigma B)
\end{equation}
where $P_{\text{prior}}(\sigma B)$ is the assumed prior probability, here chosen to be flat in $\sigma B$, for $\sigma B$ > 0. The constant factor $N$ normalises the total probability to one. The posterior probability is evaluated for each mass and decay channel as well as for their 
combination, and then used to set a limit on $\sigma B$.\\
\\As we can see, the inputs for the evaluation of $\mathcal{L}_B$ (and $P_{\text{post}}$) are $\varepsilon_{\text{sig}}$, $L_{\text{int}}$, $N_{\text{bkg}}$ and $N_{\text{obs}}$ and the uncertainties of the first three. The uncertainties for these should account for experimental 
and theoretical systematic effects as well as the statistics of the simulated samples. For this thesis the systematic uncertainties will not be calculated, but will rather be asumed to be $\pm$ 30\% of the background, as this is roughly the standard value of other ATLAS papers.\\
\\To make exclusions we can use Eq. (\ref{eq:prior_prob}) to establish a \textit{confidence limit} (CL). CLs are deined as the probablity to observe the number of events observed in an experiment, $N_{\text{obs}}$, or \textit{less} given singal+background. We usually define a signal+background 
hypothesis to be excluded whene CL$_{s+b}$ < 5\%. Meaning a 95\% CL. Such that the probability to falsely exclude an existing signal(+background) is 5\%. The standard practice in particle physics when using CL is to \textit{set limits} on theoretical models, rahter than exclude them.\\
\\On the other side, to claim any discovery in particle physics we need to know the \textit{significance} of any statistical fluctiation. Before getting to the significance we can discuss the \textit{p-value}, defined as the probability to observe the number of events observed in the experiment, $n_{\text{obs}}$, 
or \textit{more} given only background
\begin{equation}\label{eq:p-value}
    p = P(N\ge N_{\text{obs}}\vert \lambda = N_{\text{bkg}}) = \sum_{k=N_{\text{obs}}}^{\infty}\mathcal{L}(k\vert N_{\text{bkg}})
\end{equation}
The smaller the $p-$value, the less compatible an observation is with the background only hypothesis, meaning more likely to be a discovery! From this we can define the significance $Z$ By
$$
    p = \int_{-\infty}^{-Z} \frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}dx
$$
As mentioned in the start of this subsection, a discovery in particle physics is defined to be at least a $Z=5\sigma$ deviation from the background hypothesis, meaning that we would have a $p-$value of $p\le2.87\times10^{-7}$. In other words, with a $5\sigma$ deviation, the probabilty to 
falsely discover something is at worst \textbf{one in roughly 3.5 million}.\\ 
\\As the significance is an interesting quantity we can give it its own definition. In this thesis we will use the low statistics formula for the significance, as this is the most general one. We can either define the significance as the \textit{observed significance} by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:obs_sig}
    Z = \sqrt{2\left[N_{\text{obs}}\ln\frac{N_{\text{obs}}}{N_{\text{bkg}}}-N_{\text{obs}}+N_{\text{bkg}}\right]}
\end{equation}
or as the \textit{expected significance} by changing $N_{\text{obs}} \rightarrow N_{\text{sig}}+N_{\text{bkg}}$, where $N_{\text{sig}}$ is the number of signal events
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exp_sig}
    Z = \sqrt{2\left[(N_{\text{sig}}+N_{\text{bkg}})\ln\left(1+\frac{N_{\text{sig}}}{N_{\text{bkg}}}\right)-N_{\text{sig}}\right]}
\end{equation}
However, Eq. (\ref{eq:p-value}) did not include any nuisance parameters, it used Eq. (\ref{eq:observed_events_prob}) instead of Eq. (\ref{eq:observed_events_nuisance}). We want to express the significance with uncertainties. From "Discovery sensitivity for a counting experiment with background uncertainty" from Glen Cowan 
\cite{Cowan_Uncertainty_in_sig}, we can use Eq. (17) on his paper that reads
$$
Z = \left[-2\left(N_{\text{obs}}\ln\left[\frac{N_{\text{obs}}+m}{(1+\tau)N_{\text{obs}}}\right] + m\ln\left[\frac{\tau(N_{\text{obs}}+m)}{(1+\tau)m}\right]\right)\right]^{1/2}
$$
where $m=\tau N_{\text{bkg}}$ and Eq. (19) that reads
$$
\tau=\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2}
$$
where $\sigma_{\text{bkg}}$ is the uncertainty of the background. This gives us
\begin{equation}\label{eq:significance}
    Z = \sqrt{-2\left(N_{\text{obs}}\ln\left[\frac{N_{\text{obs}}+\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}^2}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2} }{(1+\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2})N_{\text{obs}}}\right] + \frac{N_{\text{bkg}}^2}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2} \ln\left[\frac{\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2}(N_{\text{obs}}+\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}^2}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2} )}{(1+\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2})\frac{N_{\text{bkg}}^2}{\sigma_{\text{bkg}}^2}}\right]\right)}
\end{equation}
Which makes for a better estimate of the significance one has in reality.

\section{Summary}
\todo{Add more about kinematic variables, also mention classical data analysis and setting limits}
We can now dive into how particles are identified now that the main four parts of the ATLAS detector; \textit{inner-detector} (ID), \textit{electromagnetic calorimeter} (ECAL), \textit{hadronic calorimeter} (HCAL), and the \textit{muon spectometer} (MS), have 
briefly been explained. For an easier understanding on the different parts I refer the reader again to Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers} which shows visually how different particles interact with the detector. We can start by noting tht there are only three types 
of particles that interact with the ID, muons, protons and electrons (there might also be other ellectrically charged hadrons that interact withg the ID). From the ID pixel and SCT detectors we can get information about $\phi,\eta, p_T$ and from the TRT we  
can get to know the \textit{the charge} of the particles (depending on how the magnet bends their trajectories)\footnote{So as we know that the proton is positively charged, then we know that the muon and electron in Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers} have negative charge}. 
Going to the next layer we see that in the ECAL the electron is completely stopped, such that we can know its energy, $E$. We can also note that the photons will interact with matter here and also be completely stopped. It is worth noting that in just the two 
first detector parts we have all the information we need to calculate interesting kinematic variables for the electron and photons. Going further into the detector, we see that the HCAL completely stops the proton and now interacts with the neutrons, giving us 
information about their energies (and location for neutrons). Lastly we see that the muon flyes through all of this and finally hits the MS where we can get information about its energy. \textit{\textbf{Note/Question to Farid/Eirik: Why does it not stop?}}. \\
\\The noteworthy particle in Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_layers}, which was not mentioned in the summary above either, is the \textit{neutrino}. The reason for this is because the neutrino, just like DM, is an \textit{invisible particle}, meaning that it does not 
interact with matter. We can still reconstruct information about the neutrino and DM howevever, we do this as explained in Section \ref{sec:particle_kinematics} with variables such as the MET, Eq. (\ref{eq:MET}), as we know the centre of mass energy that went 
into the collision. \\
\\Another thing to add is that the explanation of the detector is brief in this thesis. The reality is much more complicated than this as there are, i.e. \textit{triggers} (which might be excluding DM events) choosing which events are 
"important enough to record" as the \textit{hardware and data storage} is a big problem considering the magnitude of events that happen each second. There are as well as algorithmic precedures to calculate the variables aforementioned from the detector signal 
which both consume energy and time. As this is not the focus of my thesis I will refer the reader to further literature explaining the real hardships when collecting data at the ATLAS detector and other LHC projects. \\
