While the standard model of particle physics has been incredibly successful in describing the behavior of subatomic particles, it is not a complete description of the universe. For example, the standard model cannot explain the mysterious gravitational forces that hold galaxies together, 
and it fails to account for the abundance of matter that we observe in the universe.\\
\\These mysteries have led scientists to propose the existence of Dark Matter (DM), a mysterious substance that makes up a significant fraction of the matter in the universe. The name DM comes from the fact that we cannot observe the particles as they do not interact with matter via any of the 
forces described by the SM. This makes it extremely difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, which is why we know it is there \cite{DM1, DM2}. In this thesis we will look at so-called 
Weakly Iinterating Massive Particles (WIMP) DM candidates. There is no formal definition of a WIMP, but boadly it is a new elemntary particle which interacts via gravty and other forces, potentially outside the SM.\\
\\There are several extension of the SM that include DM candidate particles interacting via a so-called Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Lagrangian. Such as Supersymmetry \cite{JUNGMAN1996195},  Universal Extra Dimensions \cite{DIENES199947} and little Higgs \cite{ARKANIHAMED2001232}. 
In this chapter we will present the BSM models we will be studying that have a dilepton and Missing Transverse Energy final state.

\section{Beyond Standard Model candidates}
Six of the models that will be studied in this thesis come from a new theoretical gauge boson that behaves like the $Z$ boson. The theory is based on the papers by Bauer et. al. \cite{ Zp_DM_candidate2} which have previously been studied by the ATLAS collaboration \cite{Zp_DM_candidate3} and CMS collaboration \cite{Zp_DM_candidate1}. \\
\\The models we will study assume a $U(1)'$ symmetry for a new $Z'$ gauge boson, from this we can extend the SM Lagrangian from Eq. (\ref{eq:sm}), to include the $Z'$ coupling to the SM particles by
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}\supset -\sum_q g_q \overline{q}\gamma^\mu q Z'_\mu
\end{equation}
where the coupling are the same for as for gauged baryon number $U(1)_B$ with $g_q=\frac{g_B}{6}$. more text ... 

\subsection{Z' Dark Higgs}
A model with a new $Z'$ naturally comes with a set of scalars responsible for SSB. We will look at a new scalar particle that couples to the $Z'$, which we will call the Dark Higgs (DH) $h_D$. Analogous to the SM Higgs process where the boson decays from a $W$ or $Z$, this DH decays from the $Z'$. 
In addition we will assume that this DH boson couples with invisible states, such as DM. A minimal model for this process, with the $U(1)'$ symmetry as well as a $\Phi_D$ scalar field with an invisible singlet scalar $\phi_\chi$ can be seen below
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}\supset \abs{D_\mu\Phi_D}^2 + \mu_D^2\abs{\Phi_D}^2 -\lambda_D\abs{\Phi_D}^2-\frac{1}{4}(F'_{\mu\nu})^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi_\chi)-\lambda_\chi\abs{\Phi_D}^2\phi_\chi^2 - V(\phi_\chi)
\end{equation}
with the DH field $\Phi_D =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(v_D+h_D)$ obtaining a vacuum expectation value giving mass to the $Z'$, $m_{Z'}$. The coupling of the DH with $Z'$ is
\begin{equation}
    Q_hg_ZM_{Z'}h_DZ'_\mu Z'^\mu \equiv g_{h_D}M_{Z'}h_DZ'_\mu Z'^\mu
\end{equation}
where $Q_h$ is the charge of the $\Phi_D$ which is a free parameter.
The model can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:DH}

\subsection{Z' Light Vector}
Another decay of this symmetry group that gives rise to a dilepton and MET final state, is when the $Z'$ is relatively light.
$$
\mathcal{L}\supset \overline{\chi}(i\slashed{D}-M_d)\chi - \frac{M_m}{2}(\overline{\chi}\chi + h.c)
$$
where
$$
\frac{g_\chi}{2}Z'_\mu(\overline{\chi}_2\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\chi_1 + \overline{\chi}_1\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\chi_2)

\subsection{Z' Effective Field Theory}
The third where we do not assume anything about the couplings is when we look at an Effective Field Theory (EFT) description of the process. For this we have
$$
\frac{1}{2\Lambda^2}\overline{q}\gamma_\mu q(\overline{\chi}_2\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\chi_1 + \overline{\chi}_1\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\chi_2)
