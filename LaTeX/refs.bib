The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data that has been used by physicists in a search for the Higgs boson. The Challenge was organized by a small group of ATLAS physicists and data scientists. It was hosted  by Kaggle at \urlhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson; the challenge data is now available on \url\opendataLink. This paper provides the physics background and explains the challenge setting, the challenge design, and analyzes its results.}
