\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, a massive shoutout to my incredible supervisor, Farid Ould-Saada, who not only gave me the chance to embark on this wild project but also embraced my crazy ideas. I mean, who else would entertain my attempt at creating a QML algorithm for HEP? And let's not forget the time I insisted on throwing in new models just two weeks before the deadline. Thank you, Farid. \\
\\A special mention goes to Eirik Gramstad, who deserves a medal for putting up with my incessant nagging. Our discussions about coding (him finding typos in my code) saved me from countless local minima that threatened to drive me bonkers. If it weren't for your open-door policy for my "quick questions," I'd probably still be stuck in a maze of confusion. Thanks, Eirik, you're a true hero!\\
\\Major shoutout to the whole HEPP section crew, you all are absolute legends! Who would've thought I'd actually enjoy quizzing in my masters? And let's not forget the true hero of the section - the coffee machine. That magical elixir flowing freely, fueling my late-night study sessions. You saved me, caffeine wizard!\\
\\To my squad of friends, both the OGs and the new fam I met along this wild ride, you all deserve a standing ovation. Thanks for putting up with my epic shenanigans and being the ultimate hype squad that always lifted my spirits. Together, we rocked the world of physics and had a blast while doing it. And to my old buddies, guess what? The wait is over - I'm finally free from the physics shackles!\\
\\Last but absolutely not least, a heartfelt thank you to Kristina. You're my rockstar, my partner-in-crime, and the reason I'm standing here today with this thesis in hand, ready to conquer the world. Your unwavering support and quirky vibes kept me going when the going got tough. I owe you more than words can express, and our adventures are just getting started! Let's take on the world, one quirky step at a time.

% First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor Farid Ould-Saada, for giving me the opportunity of pursuing this project and supporting my crazy ideas, such as me trying to make a QML algorithm to use in HEP, 
% and to include new models to update my results two weeks before I hand in, and also allowing me to participate in multiple conferences that broadened my view of academia.
% I would also want to thank Eirik Gramstad for putting up with my constant nagging and the in depth discussions we had about ML. If he had not had his door open for my multiple "quick questions", I would have not
% been able to overcome many of the local minima I found myself stuck in. I also would like to thank everyone at the ATLAS group at UiO, for the insight they shared with me on the [few] weekly meetings I attended. 
% I also need to thank the coffee machine at the HEPP section for the incredible support in times of need, as the coffee was free. \coffeestainA{0.2}{0.85}{120}{4cm}{-6.5cm}\\
% \\I also want to thank my friends, old, and new ones that I have made in the path of pursuing knowledge. Thank you for sharing your care and putting up with my shenanigans. 
% For my old friends; now that I am done, I will finally be able to hang out once again.\\
% \\Lastly, I would like to thank Kristina, I wouldn't be here without you.
