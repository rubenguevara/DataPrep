# DataPrep
This is a repo for the preparation of data to be used in my master thesis.
The data used in this directory can be found in EventSelector. The data generated there are root ntules and histograms. The root ntuples are made into a Pandas DataFrame in ml_file_maker then made into readable hdf5 files. This code showcases the plots that are used as the variables for machine learning. 
The actual .h5 files are not included in this repo due to their size.
