# Master Thesis
This is my repo for my masters thesis: Model independent search for Dark Matter in dilepton + MET final states with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
So far it is divided in three categories:
1. EventSelector: Which includes the algorithm used to choose events of both Datapoints and Monte Carlo simulations of the Large Hadron Collider and make these into readable files for plotting and Machine Learning (ML). 
2. DataPrep: Which both plots the kinematic variables to be used in ML and prepares the files in a ML friendly format.
3. ML: Here are the main algorithms made to train a Neural Network and Boosted Decision Tree to distinguish signal (Dark matter) from backround (The Standard Model)
More info on each category is inside the respective category. A LaTeX file with a pdf containing the theory behind everything is to come later.
